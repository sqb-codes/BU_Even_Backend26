Introduction to React

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
- React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and


Features:
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state., then compose them to make complex UIs.
- Declarative: in order to build reusable UI components and design simple views for each state in your application.
- One Way Data Binding - React follows one way data binding where data flows from parent component to the child component
- Child component cannot return data directly to the parent component but they can communicate with parent to modify states
- Follows Virtual DOM

Understand DOM first:
- DOM stands for Document Object Model is a structured representation of the HTML
- It is represented as a tree data structure

Virtual DOM:
- React follows Virtual DOM which is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
- Manipulating DOM in JS is slow as compare to React Virtual DOM
- Each time there is a change in state of our application, first Virtual DOM gets updated and then compared with actual DOM

Virtual DOM - lightweight copy of actual DOM
Actual DOM - Actual tree representation of HTML elements

Virtual DOM - Maintained by JS libraries
Actual DOM - It is maintained by browser


JSX - JavaScript XML / JavaScript Syntax Extension

Take JS example:
const name = "John";
let h2_tag = document.createElement("h2");
h2_tag.innerText = "Hello " + name;


Take React JSX example:
const name = "John";
<h2>Hello {name}</h2>


Setup React
1. Install Node JS
2. Install vite
Vite - simple, fast and modern way to build frontend applications

npm create vite@latest first-app
