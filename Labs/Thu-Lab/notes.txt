React
- JS based UI development library
- React is a library rather than a language
- It was introduced in May 2013 by Facebook

Key features:
1. Component based
 - React divides web pages into reusable and immutable components
 - Component-based development simplifies code organization and maintain reusability

2. One Way Data Binding
- React follows one way data binding, where data flows from Parent component to child component

3. JSX - JavaScript syntax extension / JavaScript XML
- Combines JS and HTML, allows embedding of JS objects within HTML elements

JavaScript Example:
const username = "John";
const element = document.createElement("h2");
element.style.color = "red";
element.innerText = "Hello " + username;

JSX:
const username = "John";
<h2 style=color:red;>Hello {username}</h2>

4. Virtual DOM
- Virtual representation of actual DOM
- React updates the state changes in Virtual DOM and then it sync with Real DOM
- Virtual DOM is a blueprint of a machine, can do changes in blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine

How Virtual DOM works?
- In React everything is treated as a component (functional/class)
- Each component has a state
- Whenever the state of any component is changed react updates the virtual DOM.
- React maintains two virtual DOM at each time and contains the updated virtual DOM and which is pre-updated of the newly updated DOM.
- Then it compares pre-updated version with newly updated DOM and figure out the changes that has to be implemented in actual DOM.
- This process is known as diffing

The entire process of transforming changes to the real DOM is called Reconcilliation
